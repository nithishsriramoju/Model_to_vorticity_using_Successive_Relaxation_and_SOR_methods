# Model_to_vorticity_using_Successive_Relaxation_and_SOR_methods

#### This project is aimed at to produce vorticity using successive over relaxation algorithm.

#### Every time vorticity data is written into poisson.txt and then plotted using plot.py

#### In successive relaxation algorithm, when β=0.5 the algorithm takes 2195 steps to reach convergence.

#### When β=1, algorithm takes 754 steps to reach convergence.

#### when β=1.5, algorithm takes 274 steps to reach convergence.

#### when β=2, algorithm never reaches convergence and collapes.

#### Result figures are shown in format Figure_(β_Value)_(number_of_steps_to_converge).

#### This result is further used in moving_non-divergent_barotropic_vorticity.
